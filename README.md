# swagger-travel-groups

Travel Groups is a group travel planning application that allows its users to create travel plans,
invite their friends to travel with them and determine the optimal mode of transportation for their
trip. 

This is strictly an API defined in Swagger. There are no controllers defined so it is not functional.
